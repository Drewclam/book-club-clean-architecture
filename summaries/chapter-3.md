## Chapter 3: Paradigm Overview

- Structured Programming
  Discovered in 1968, `goto` statements were replaced by `if/then/else` and `do/while/until` constructs.

> Structures programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control

- Object Oriented Programming
  Discovered in 1966, call stack frame moved to a heap allowing local variables to exist after the function returned. The function became the class constructor. Local variables to instance variables and nested functions became class methods. This led to the discovery of polymorphism via function pointers.

> Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control

- Functional Programming

Discovered in 1936 with the invention of 1-calculus which is the foundation of LISP language (1958). A core concept of 1-calculus was immutability; the values of symbols do not change. Therefore, a functional language has no assignment statement.

### Food for Thought

Each paradigm above imposes restrictions on the developer. What's left?

### Conclusion

These three paradigms align with concerns of architecture: function, separation of components, and data management.
