# Book Club - Clean Architecture

### ["Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design"](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/), by Robert C. Martin

> Uncle Bob presents the universal rules of software architecture that will help you dramatically improve developer productivity throughout the life of any software system.

> "A good architecture comes from understanding it more as a journey than as a destination, more as an ongoing process of enquiry than as a frozen artifact." -- Kevlin Henney

### Meeting agenda:

We get together every two weeks for 30 min to talk about the chapter(s). Each meeting consists of an informal 5-10 min review then discussion, e.g. [lean coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) style or whatever structure the group prefers. For example, we could discuss what we found helpful, unhelpful, and needed clarifying. As you read chapters, if you think of something you want to ask or discuss ahead of meeting time, you can also jot it down in the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zqibYxCscLDwUA1RxSPYocpEXKayN940PkXfhMuSiBE/) to discuss on the day. Finally, while it's to your benefit to read the chapter ahead of time, it's not mandatory and you should aim to come to book club regardless. Questions from all levels of experience helps solidify everyone's learning.
